Hi,

The following is a quickie Common Lisp script that generates a 8.5x11
page of code39 labels suitable for sticking onto AIT tape so they can
be numbered for changers that have barcode scanners.

To run it, you'll need a Common Lisp implementation installed.  I
developed it using CLISP but CMUCL or most any other one should work.
It should work fine on any OS that hosts a usable Lisp implementation
and can pipe to a file and submit it to a PS printer.

Run as;

clisp -q ait-label.lisp | lp

Since it generates data to stdio, it can be piped to less for
debugging.  To change the tape numbers, edit the parameters in the
lisp file.  It wouldn't be hard to take parameters on the commandline
or prompt for them, but whaddya want for free...

I just tested its codes in our tape changer and they work fine.

Thanks!

Hi Terry,

Here is a final update.  The previous version, while interesting, just
prints a couple columns of barcodes, but would not print to match
common adhesive label paper formats.  I modified the script to accept 
the definition of a page of labels, then print barcodes to fill each 
"pane" which can then be sheared out.

So the new version has a definition for Avery 6873 labels and can be
modified for additional label page layouts also.  All thats required
is a sample of the label page and a ruler to measure the various
parameters.  The "bcode" invocation at the end of the script is what
executes the program, so the parameters can be changed according to
local preferences.

This makes the script a whole lot more useful.

Greg
